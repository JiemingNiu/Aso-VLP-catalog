# Aso-VLP-catalog
This folder archives the original long-period-tremor (LPT) or very-long-period signal (VLP) catalog from 2011 to 2016 produced by Niu & Song (2020, JVGR), and further analyses by Niu & Song (2021, GRL) and Niu & Song (2021, in review). 

--> The first column in each file indicates the calendar time of single LPT event in JST; 
--> The second column indicates the cross-correlation coefficient in 0.03-0.1 Hz; 
--> The third column indicates the signal-to-noise ratio in 0.03-0.1 Hz.  

Please see the details of the catalog construction in Niu and Song (2020, JVGR). The suffix of each file indicates the calendar year of the part of the catalog.
